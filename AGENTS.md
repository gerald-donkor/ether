# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# 1. Workflow

For every implementation request:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and follow its instructions as the highest priority project guidance. `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for implementation decisions. User requests may override these rules only when the user explicitly requests a deviation, explains why, and the relevant rule is intentionally changed.
2. Read the skills explicitly mentioned by the user.
3. Read clearly needed supporting skills.
4. Inspect only the code, files, and dependencies relevant to the request. Do not inspect, modify, or reason about unrelated parts of the repository unless they directly affect the approved implementation.
5. Ask a focused question only if the task has meaningful ambiguity. Do not ask questions when reasonable assumptions can be made without affecting the implementation outcome.
6. Create a detailed prompt file in `prompts/` per the contract in section 4.
7. Ask: `I prepared the implementation prompt at prompts/<file-name>.md. Is this good to execute?`
8. On approval, re-read the approved prompt file in `prompts/` and implement it strictly. Implement only after user approval. Entering "y" or "Y" = `Approved. Execute.`
9. Run available checks.
10. Share exact steps to test or run the completed feature.
11. Commit the resulting change to `main`, unprompted. Every executed prompt ends in a commit — never leave implemented work uncommitted. Do not push unless asked.

Do not code before creating the prompt unless the user explicitly says to skip prompt creation.

**Why step 11 matters.** Resolving what is already built (below, and on any resume) reads the files on disk and `git log`, never the prompt files. Work left uncommitted makes that resolution wrong and invites a duplicate prompt for a feature that already exists.

**Resuming in a new session.** Entering `I` or `i` = `Work out what comes next and write its prompt file.` It runs steps 1–7 of this workflow and stops at the approval question. It never implements anything — `i` writes the prompt, `y` executes it.

Resolving what "next" means, in a session with no prior context:

1. **The number** is the highest existing prompt number in `prompts/` plus one. Never renumber, never overwrite, never reuse a number (section 4).
2. **The scope** is the next unbuilt item from section 1's build list, ordered by what unblocks the most downstream work. The spec's four-phase roadmap (section 7 of the spec) is the narrative for why that order exists; use it as context, not as a checklist to walk mechanically.
3. **Establish what is already built from the repository** — the files on disk and `git log` — not from the existing prompt files. A committed prompt file is evidence that a prompt was written, never that it was executed. Writing a prompt for work that already exists is the main failure mode here.
4. **Name the chosen scope and say why it is next in the first line of the reply**, before writing the file, so a wrong call is visible immediately.
5. If two candidates are genuinely equally unblocking, write neither yet — name both, state the trade-off, and ask.

Then finish with step 7's question as written.
